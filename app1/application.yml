      selfHeal: true # Specifies if partial app sync should be executed when resources are changed only in target Kubernetes cluster and no git change detected ( false by default ).
      allowEmpty: false # Allows deleting all application resources during automatic syncing ( false by default ).

    #   - Validate=false # disables resource validation (equivalent to 'kubectl apply --validate=false') ( true by default ).
    #   - CreateNamespace=true # Namespace Auto-Creation ensures that namespace specified as the application destination exists in the destination cluster.
    #   - PrunePropagationPolicy=foreground # Supported policies are background, foreground and orphan.
    #   - PruneLast=true # Allow the ability for resource pruning to happen as a final, implicit wave of a sync operation
    #   - RespectIgnoreDifferences=true # When syncing changes, respect fields ignored by the ignoreDifferences configuration

  # RevisionHistoryLimit limits the number of items kept in the application's revision history, which is used for
  # informational purposes as well as for rollbacks to previous versions. This should only be changed in exceptional
  # circumstances. Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used. Increasing will increase the
  # space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.
